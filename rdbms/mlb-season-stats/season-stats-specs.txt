The following is the structure for the mlb_season_stats database.

CREATE TABLE season_stats_team (
    team_id varchar(3) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    league varchar(8) NOT NULL,
    region varchar(7) NOT NULL,
    wins int NOT NULL,
    losses int NOT NULL,
    result varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    stadium varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    manager_name varchar(255) NOT NULL
);

league is always either "American" or "National", and region is always either "East", "Central", or "West"
A division refers to a combination between league and region (Example: "American" and "East" is called the "AL East")
If a team name is given, search using a substring.

Below are the possible result values:
Lost AL Wild Card Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost NL Wild Card Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost ALDS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost NLDS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost ALCS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost NLCS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost World Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Won World Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.

For any baseball terms that cannot be found on here, use the MLB official calculations to obtain those values. If the general term "player" is used, search both batters and pitchers ONLY if stat we're looking for is shared. If an attribute does not exist for a given table, DO NOT try to join with that table. Treat ALL abbreviations as case INSENSITIVE.
