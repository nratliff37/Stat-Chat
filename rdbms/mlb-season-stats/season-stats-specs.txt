The following is the structure for the mlb_season_stats database.

CREATE TABLE season_stats_team (
    team_id varchar(3) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    league varchar(8) NOT NULL,
    region varchar(7) NOT NULL,
    wins int NOT NULL,
    losses int NOT NULL,
    result varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    stadium varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    manager_name varchar(255) NOT NULL
);

Here are the team id-name pairs:
BAL: Baltimore Orioles
BOS: Boston Red Sox
NYY: New York Yankees
TB: Tampa Bay Rays
TOR: Toronto Blue Jays
CLE: Cleveland Guardians
CWS: Chicago White Sox
DET: Detroit Tigers
KC: Kansas City Royals

CIN: Cincinnati Reds
MIL: Milwaukee Brewers
PIT: Pittsburgh Pirates

league is always either "American" or "National", and region is always either "East", "Central", or "West"
A division refers to a combination between league and region (Example: "American" and "East" is called the "AL East")
If a team name is given, search using a substring.

Below are the possible result values:
Lost AL Wild Card Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost NL Wild Card Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost ALDS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost NLDS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost ALCS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost NLCS (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Lost World Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.
Won World Series (X-Y), where X-Y is the series score.

CREATE TABLE season_stats_batter (
    player_id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    player_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    team_id varchar(3) NOT NULL,
    position varchar(2) NOT NULL,

    on_base_pct float,
    slugging float,
    ops float,
    CONSTRAINT batters_idfk FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES season_stats_team (team_id)
);

When a position is referenced, translate the following:
First baseman -> 1B
Second baseman -> 2B
Third baseman -> 3B
Outfielder -> OF
Shortshop -> SS
Catcher -> C
Designated Hitter -> DH

CREATE TABLE season_stats_pitcher (
    player_id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    player_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    team_id varchar(3) NOT NULL,
    age int NOT NULL,
    num_games int,
    games_started int,
    complete_games int,
    shutouts int,
    innings_pitched float,
    hits int,
    earned_runs int,
    strikeouts int,
    walks int,
    home_runs int,
    wins int,
    losses int,
    saves int,
    blown_saves int,
    holds int,
    era float,
    whip float,
    CONSTRAINT pitchers_idfk FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES season_stats_team (team_id)
);

For any baseball terms that cannot be found on here, use the MLB official calculations to obtain those values. If the general term "player" is used, search both batters and pitchers ONLY if stat we're looking for is shared. If an attribute does not exist for a given table, DO NOT try to join with that table. Treat ALL abbreviations as case INSENSITIVE.
